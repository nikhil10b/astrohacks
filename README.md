### Inspiration
The inspiration behind CosmoQuest comes from a deep-rooted fascination with the cosmos and a desire to make space exploration more accessible and engaging. Recognizing the vast potential of technology in revolutionizing our understanding of the universe, we aimed to create a comprehensive platform that not only serves as an educational resource but also a community hub for space enthusiasts and technophiles.

### What it does
CosmoQuest is an innovative platform that brings the universe to users' fingertips. Key features include:

1. Community Chat: A MERN stack-based chat application for like-minded space enthusiasts to connect and share ideas.

2. Picture of the Day: Showcasing daily images from NASA, inspiring users with the beauty of space.

3. Custom GPT: Utilizing GPT-4, this AI answers space-related queries, enhancing the educational aspect of the platform.

4. Historical Events Timeline: A slider feature showing significant events in space exploration history.

5. Celestial Bodies Database: Detailed insights into various celestial bodies and their characteristics.

6. Virtual Space Visualization: Providing an immersive experience of space images using panorama image, with future goals to incorporate AR/VR technology.

7. Image Gallery: A collection of awe-inspiring space images from NASA's API.

### How we built it
CosmoQuest was built using a blend of modern technologies and APIs. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) forms the backbone of our web application, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. Integration with NASA's APIs allows us to fetch real-time, high-quality space data. The custom GPT, built using GPTBuilder and GPT-4, adds a unique interactive and informative dimension to the platform.
